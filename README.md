Organize, balance and track your activities:

1. **No more calendar**: just open the application and let it balance the tree.
Each tree level will be balanced with the same amount of time - higher levels
defines higher priorities. 
1. **Share your activities plan**: activities are just plain text. If you are
proud of your study plan, why not to share?
1. **Track your activities**: see the amount of time you worked at each level of
the activities tree, from the leaves to the root.
